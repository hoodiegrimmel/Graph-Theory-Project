# Random Graphs and the Threshold Effect

## Why did you do this?

Github has automatic formatting with markdown and I cannot be bothered to learn and format my own document on overleaf or some other latex editor.

## What's in here?

### Threshold Proofs

Contains all the proofs except hamiltonicity.

### Report

Where we compare the theoretical threshold against the experimental results.

### Code

Experimental code you can run on your own device, detailed instructions are included in the readme.md.
